### What is this

This is the prototype of ttyhlauncher 2.0 written in C# with GTK GUI.
Currently all prototype's ideas are implemented in the
original [ttyhlauncher](https://github.com/dngulin/ttyhlauncher) (C++, Qt).

This version works pretty on linux, but have some issues with GTK on other operation systems.
You can also look at [fork](https://github.com/disba1ancer/ttyhlauncher2) with Winforms GUI.
